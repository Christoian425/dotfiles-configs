# dotfiles-configs
A repository for the storage of my dotfiles and configs. If I decide to do something else,
I will update this readme.
Also, don't expect frequent, interesting, and/or "cool" updates; I'm learning and slow. :-)
10/10/22: So far so good.
10/21/22: Things have continued to problem free. Works as expected. This is likely the last update.
